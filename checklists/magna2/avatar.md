Top priority to complete  
## Avatar Staves
2 FLB Staves. Do this before you start ULBing claws, unless you have excess anima compared to staff drops.
5 FLB Staves. Useful for dark OTKs. Even if you play hades depending on what weapons you have you may still want this for OTK.
## Celeste Claws
4 ULB Celeste Claws. Claws make up the majority of the damage of celeste grids.
## Avatar Guns
Do not use avatar guns.
