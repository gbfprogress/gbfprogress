# Alexiel Checklist
## Yggdrasil FLB
Top priority to complete  
## Alexiel Axes
1 0lb Axes. Can be slotted into your M1 grid. FLB'ing this axe before continuing  
1 FLB Axes. Additional axes should be FLB  
2 FLB Axes. More stamina, but at this point you'll probably feel some wild damage variance from crits  
3 FLB Axes. 100% crit with Ygg x Ygg. Good initial stopping point  
5 FLB Axes. 100% crit with Ygg x non-Ygg, useful for OTK setups
## Alexiel Katanas
1 Alexiel Katana. If resources collide you do this after alexiel axes are at 3. Replace sword with katana for free hp.  
2 Alexiel Katanas.  
3 Alexiel Katanas. This is a good stopping point, you shouldn't generally need more.  

## Alexiel Daggers
1 Alexiel Dagger. Very low priority but occasionally useful for when you are capping everything and don't have any other way to cram in more cap ups.
