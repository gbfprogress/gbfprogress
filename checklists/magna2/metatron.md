# Metatron Checklist
## Chevalier FLB
Top priority to complete  
## Chevalier Swords
6 ULB Swords. ULB-ing swords is a direct power boost to your grid.
## Metatron Bows
1-2 FLB Bows. Do not use bows pre-FLB. Use 1-bow maximum once you have ULB opus with stamina (usage mostly confined to off-element). As such metatron bows are fairly low priority once you have ULB opus but you may still want to keep 1 around.
