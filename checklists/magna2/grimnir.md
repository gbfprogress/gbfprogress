# Grimnir Checklist
## Tiamat FLB
Top priority to complete  
## Grimnir Harps
1 0lb Harp. Can be slotted into your M1 grid. FLB'ing this harp before continuing  
1 FLB Harp. Additional harps should be FLB  
2 FLB Harps  
3 FLB Harps. 100% crit with Tiamat x Tiamat. Good initial stopping point  
4 FLB Harps. Stamina-oriented grid  
5 FLB Harps. 100% crit with Tiamat x non Tiamat. Very useful for wind OTK setups  
## Tiamat Guns
3 ULB Guns. A good benchmark, lesser priority than completing 3 FLB harps  
6 ULB Guns. Shouldn't ever need more outside of extremely niche setups
