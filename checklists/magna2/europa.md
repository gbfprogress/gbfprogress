# Europa Checklist
## Leviathan FLB
Top priority to complete
## Europa Harps
2 FLB Harps. At this point you've maxed out your cap.  
3 FLB Harps. Often you'll want a 3rd to guarantee that you cap ougis, especially on harder content. Also useful as it caps sentence completely in levi x levi.  
5 FLB Harps. OTK and high defense content.  
## Europa staves
2 FLB Staves. Staff team is better damage than kengo team, but more character restricted. Farm these if you have the characters, or to futureproof.  
## Leviathan Daggers
1-2 ULB Dagger. Occasionally useful on content where you easily cap ougis with 2 FLB harps, but low priority.
