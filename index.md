This is a (in-progress, incomplete) comprehensive progression guide to Granblue Fantasy.

It is intended to cover gaps where the overall English community has failed to provide meaningful guidance to both new and experienced players on how to properly progress. Guidance will also focus on efficient resource expenditure throughout both the early, mid, and late phases of the game.
