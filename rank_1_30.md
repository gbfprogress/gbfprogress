# Rank 1-30

As a fresh player, your top priority is to get rank 30 as fast as possible. During this time it is okay to be confused about various things in the user interface and how damage works. The primary way you will rank up is by doing the main quest - it costs no AP (a resource that is used for hosting solo quests and raids) so you will not be time gated in completing it. You can burn your excess AP on side quests (various quests that are located at the same place as some main story quest, but isn't necessary to complete for progression in the main quest).

Progressing in the main quest unlocks various things at particular chapters. The most notable bits are:
- After chapter 4, you unlock the ability to [join a crew](early_crew_selection.md)
- After chapter 10, you unlock the side story [Princess Connection collaboration](https://gbf.wiki/Princess_Connect!_Re:Dive:_Dinner_at_the_Turned_Table) which has three SSR characters. In particular, [Kokkoro](https://gbf.wiki/Kokkoro) can be the backbone support of a wind team until you start to unlock eternals in the early-midgame.
- As you progress through the different islands you will unlock "Hard" difficulty magna fights, which are required to unlock the classic "magna raids" that you will be hosting and farming after rank 30.
- Clearing chapter 16 is required to clear all the [pinboard missions](https://gbf.wiki/Pinboard_Missions)

While you are doing this, you will also be leveling your main characters classes. For information on what classes to start leveling first, see [class progression](t3_class_progression.md).
