## Crew Selection for Early Players

Granblue Fantasy, like most other players, has a concept of guilds/crews. A crew is made of 30 people. For progression in GBF it is important that you have a similar mindset to others in your crew.

Crews can share raids ingame, but given codes exist, one doesn't need to be in the same crew to share raids. Therefore, the primary purpose for the existence of a crew ingame is for the event known as Unite & Fight ingame, and Guild Wars/GW in the English community. Crews also give various buffs, so its important to be in one at almost all times.

Guidance on GW will be given elsewhere, but for here you need to know that there are different tiers of crews - Unranked, C, B, and A. The tier A crews themselves can further be divided into slack, 1bil/slack, and competitive. Rewards vary depending on what tier you are in. GW progression is highly timegated and it is important to not waste one in a crew that does not get rewards.

## Mindset

This will be a temporary crew. Unless you are friends with someone who can vouch for you, you won't be getting into your permanent home yet. So be aware that you will eventually be leaving this crew. However, that doesn't mean you are losing friends - a respectable crew will understand that you have a different mindset than them and not be too upset that you are leaving for greater heights.

## Tier A

Most of the rewards are obtained simply by being in tier A, so that should be your goal.

As a new player, you may find it difficult to find a tier A crew that will accept you. You should still look - however, you may have to settle for joining a different crew until you are strong enough to convince a tier A crew to take you. Depending on how much time there is before your first GW, you should be able to get to adequate strength to do a standard tier A quota (~6million in prelims) although it may take some effort. Luckily, you'll be wanting to do at least that much for other reasons anyways. Some tier A crews have lower prerequisites so it may be easier to get into those.

## Tier B

If you are unable to find a tier A crew willing to accept you at your current rank, your best option is to find a tier B crew and stay there for as small amount of time as possible (preferably not staying for GW). Do not consider joining tier C or unranked crews - they don't play the game and will substantially harm your progress. Many Tier B crews accept fresh accounts and have no prerequisites or quotas so there is never a reason to join a tier C or below crew.
