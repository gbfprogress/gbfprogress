# Farming Magna2

Farming magna2 essentially begins the moment you achieve rank 120. Your first priority for all magna2s is to flb your magna1 summon - doing so has very lenient requirements as it only requires 100 anima from each. The hefty cost in quartz is repaid by the effectiveness of the upgrade.

How many weapons to farm depends on each magna2 - some have basic stopping points and more advanced grids for OTK.

Completing your magna2s is your top priority in the early midgame. Advanced primal grinds require more time and as such are better left for after you have all your elements in a reasonable state. Your magna2 grind often will focus on the element for the upcoming GW.
