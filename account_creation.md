# Account Creation

This page assumes that you don't already have a GBF account. If you already have one and have been playing for some time then it is not necessary to follow the advice here, although depending on your goals you may wish to throw away your account and make a new one if you haven't progressed very far. Still, the remainder of the guide will assume the worst case for your start.

## Start Date

Start date is considered important for two reasons. It influences the gacha that you will be rerolling in, and also fixes for your accounts lifetime the content of the "startdash" which is the best pay to win deal the game has to offer. Even if you *think* you do not plan on spending money, the startdash is a one-time deal that many players eventually find worth it and you can think of it as being similar to the up-front cost of the game in that sense.

The best times to start are at the start of the month (Legfest) and in the middle of the month (Flashfest) which have limited characters in their startdash as well as the gacha pool in addition to an increased SSR rate of 6%.

## Rerolling

GBF is a gacha game, which inherently means that rolls are one of the most valuable resources. The creation of a new account is essentially the *only* time in the game that you have the ability to farm rolls. Therefore it is **highly recommended** that you take the time to reroll.

If you are lucky enough to be starting during a roulette event (Christmas and March Anniversary), the best strategy is to make a large number of accounts and then obtain their free roulette roll daily, then choose an account at the end.

## Spending your Startdash

Depending on your immediate goals and whether you want to spend the startdash immediately, you may choose to wait until after your first spark to spend it to have a better idea of what to buy. But the general advice is to always choose a limited character that will be useful to you in the short term (if it is useful in the long term, just wait before buying it).

One of the most impactful earlygame (and lategame) characters is Summer Zooey, a Flashfest-exclusive character who more or less defines the meta for both magna (basically free-to-play) and some primal (basically pay-to-win, but can be accomplished as free-to-play) builds. There is no replacement for what she does in the game so most players will eventually want to have her.

Another alternative, if you are starting during a seasonal fest, is to get a good seasonal character from that pool. You will generally know if this is the case by asking around.

## Buying a Starter

Disregarding the ethics bit here, it is important to note that GBF is a game where important progression is locked behind summons in the gacha that cannot be reliably obtained without spending a ridiculous amount of a currency that is gacha-locked and difficult to obtain. Most players who are not spending large amounts of money will have no way to control whether or not they can obtain these summons. This includes the primal series which are needed later to take your grids to the next level, the primarch series which give you an expanded damage cap, and the notorious summon Shiva which is used to greatly increase your damage for a single turn.

Depending on your goals, not having guaranteed access to some of these can be a deal-breaker and obtaining them via rerolls can be difficult if you aren't rerolling during a roulette. In this case, you might consider buying a starter account that has the summons you are interested in for a price much less than you would have to pay to roll them yourself.

We do **not** recommend in investing in a non-starter account as it has progression you cannot claim to be your own.
