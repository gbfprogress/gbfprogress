# Collabs

Collabs typically follow the same format as a [rerun](events/rerun.md), but have FLB-able weapons and summons and as such may be worth keeping. Always check.

Highest priority (timegated):
- Arcarum points
- Tickets
- Steel bricks (But new players might prioritize damascus crystals over this)

Medium priority:
- Lineage rings
- Damascus crystals. Should be high priority if you don't have a surplus of these yet, or can't easily farm them from other sources.

Resources that you might want to buy:
- Potions (AP positive)
- Berries if you wish convert potions to berries
