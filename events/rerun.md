# Reruns

Reruns are the return of a token box event, but in a different format from its initial run. Mass farming these is usually less valuable due to the lack of token boxes.

The event weapons and summons are usually garbage/stones/quartz, but check to make sure before reducing.

Highest priority (timegated):
- Arcarum points
- Tickets
- Steel bricks (But new players might prioritize damascus crystals over this)

Medium priority:
- Lineage rings
- Damascus crystals. Should be high priority if you don't have a surplus of these yet, or can't easily farm them from other sources.

Resources that you might want to buy:
- Potions (AP positive)
- Berries if you wish convert potions to berries
