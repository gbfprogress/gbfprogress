# Rise of the Beasts

Prepare yourself, oh new player, for Rise of the Beasts is the grindiest event besides GW itself. In particular, there is a large amount of both in-total time-gated materials as well as per-event timegated materials to farm, as well as some one-time weapons that need to be obtained.

## Weapons

There are three series of weapons to be obtained from this event. The first is the "traditional" beasts weapons, which you will need to upgrade with a damage cap key. These weapons are high priority to obtain if you think you will be strong enough to use them within the next three months.

The second interesting series of weapons is a bit newer - these are magna weapons and they are all pretty useful sans maybe the earth one. The water one is only used in filler but if you are a new player you should still obtain it, and veterans can obtain them all easily for future proofing anyway.

You will want to FLB all the weapons you get which will require a seal. Furthermore for the first series you need to farm the cap up upgrade which requires spending more seals on the trials.

## Golden Seals

The general rule for seal farming is "as much as possible" purely because seals are timegated and therefore we don't know if they will ever be needed or not. In either case you actually do need a large amount of seals for farming kirin/huanglong via trains for the weapons and summons. Usually you will spend your first two seals on single-hosts for single-kirin and single-huanglong, and then spend the rest on doing trains to maximize anima gains.

You can only buy a total of 10 from the shop. Veterans should try to empty the shop, newer players may have to sacrafice being able to do so in order to make progress on gold bars.

## Gold Bars

There is a limited amount of gold bars in the shop. You generally want to be cogniscent of how many you might use in the next ~3 months (in general, assume around 2 GW before the next ROTB in the worst case). Each GW generally uses between 3-5 gold bars (less intense players to FLB one Juuten and MLB one Juuten at 48 boxes; more intensive players to ULB the opus for the GW, and FLB two juutens at 88 boxes) so farm accordingly with 6-10 bars. Of course, you'll notice that is almost all of the bars in the shop - if you are very new aim for just 6, if you are able to use more than 6 in the next three months you can probably empty the shop anyway or its your second rotb and you're done).

## Eternity rings

Farm these after you have completely emptied the gold bars from the shop. They can't be obtained anywhere else so be careful about your [usage](resource_usage/ring.md) of them.

## Potion vs Berry farming

You can farm this event either by mass-hosting or mass-joining. We tend to value berries over half potions due to their expenditure being higher for progression (e.g. you actually use them in significant quantity outside GW) and therefore recommend using potions to farm, but if you for some reason have a surplus of berries and can do significant OTK damage you can consider using berries instead.
