# Sunstone Usage

Sunstones are one of the most valuable and time-gated gbf items. There is no way to farm it so it is imperative that you *always* get a sunstone every GW. Recommendations on what to spend sunstones on:

### Core: Arcarum damage summons

These are important progression, often more worthwhile than primals because its only one stone for 5% extra seraphic mod and the ability to make an evoker corresponding to that summon. You generally only need these by the day that GW starts, though - so you can plan accordingly.

### Top Tier: Primal Summons with Free Grids

These primals have non-gacha grids that beat magna comfortably. Of course, if you have a primal and the gacha grid ready, feel free to prioritize that - assuming you have the damascus.
- Agni: Prometheus grid
- Zeus: Hector grid
- Zephryus: Morrigna grid

One could also consider Varuna to have a decent free primal grid, but it isn't as obvious of an upgrade over magna, so we do not prioritize it.

### Top Tier: Any primal summon you have a grid for

Self explanatory. If you have the grid and have already decided that you are willing to invest the [damascus bars or gold bars](resource_usage/damascus.md) then you may as well just sunstone the primal.

### Mid-Top Tier: Any Primarch in an element you have stoned the Primal

To get the most bang for sunstones its best to use them in an element you are already strong in. However, depending on how gacha treats you, this isn't always an option.

### Mid Tier: Any Primarch in another element where you already cap

Primarchs are still good sunstone usage, even if you are playing magna. This is especially true in GW which tends to be easier to cap (particularly during buff hours).

### Mid-Low Tier: Lucifer and Bahamut

Lucifer and Bahamut are in a grey area where most of the time they are not worth sunstoning but if you have a surplus of sunstones and no higher priority summons to use them on, you could consider it. You may want to keep a buffer until you roll any primal summons that you could use.

If you do happen to have them uncapped, they are generically useful as statsticks but their calls are not particularly attractive.

### Low Tier: Any Shiva-tier summon

These aren't worth stoning right now - its better to use primal main (gives more flexibility) and if you need to use them you could just use them at 0*.

### Low Tier: Any suptixable summon

Generally its better to just save your sunstones up and ticket duplicates of the summon in the long run.
